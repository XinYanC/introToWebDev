            "Long Live the Web" by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web,
            relects the creation of the web and its principles. Berners-Lee
            believes the web is a valuable source to express democracy and
            freedom of speech.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically, Berners-Lee's vision entails making web into an
            universal tool where people are able to create and make links
            without permission from a "central authority." As mentioned:
          </p>
          <i>
            <q>
              any person could share information with anyone else, anywhere
            </q>
          </i>
          <p>
            He also mentions a various of different threats to the freedom of
            the web including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              "Walled gardens" created by large social networking sites that
              locks up user data
            </li>
            <li>Internet Service Providers discrimination</li>
            <li>
              Governments and corporates violating privacy and human rights with
              monitoring
            </li>
            <li>Government and law website censorships</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A new fact I learned from this article is that the acronym "URL"
            (for Uniform Resource Locator) was originally "URI" (which is
            Universal Resource Identifier).
