        <p>
          The first thing that stands out to me from this reading are the
          interesting visuals from the reading. This is something that I am not
          used to reading. When it comes to other readings I've done, they are
          the typically formatted text with paragraphs and headings, like in
          research papers. However, this reading made me think about the
          "medium."
        </p>
        <p>
          Marshall McLuhan refers to the "medium" as a process. He points out
          that this is actually shaped by <i>how</i> content is presented more
          than <i>what</i> is presented and how that interacts with our senses.
          The most interesting example he gives is the alphabet, which combines
          the eyes with the ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading this text in itself is an message. The unique layout, images,
          and overall design of the reading impacts how we perceive and
          understand this text, making this text engaging and memorable.
        </p>
        <p>
          This makes me reflect on how I get information from the world and how
          the "medium" shapes my understanding of information.
        </p>
