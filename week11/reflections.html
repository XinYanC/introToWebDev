            First website of the class! Had a lot of fun learning the basics and
            imaging the "box."

            Started experimenting more with CSS. Learned how to use Google fonts
            and reactivity (e.g. used :hover). Also found the embed
            <code>iframe</code>
            tag. However, I also learned that unfortunately, you cannot embed
            all websites :( <br /><br />
            <code

            Experimented more with typography and layout. Took some time to
            figure out how to fit <code>div</code>s inside a constrainted area
            (laptop and phone) as well as making the content overflow properly
            for scrollage. However, I still needed to practice more with
            adjusting to different screen sizes.

            I remember doing this assignment and I was trying to move the layout
            but no matter what I did, the format did not look as I indended.
            After looking at it for over 30 minutes, I realized I just called it
            wrong in the CSS file. I was trying to move a class and I
            accidentially called it as an id (<code>#</code>) in the CSS 🤦‍♀️.
            Besides that, the assignment was very fun. I also had a lot of fun
            playing the froggy game to learn flexbox and grid!<br />
            <code># != .</code>

            Learned more about reactivity. Played around with transitions,
            animations, and different customed cursors.<br /><br />
            <code>cursor: value;</code>

            Started JS! Expanded from the class example into button grids.<br /><br />
            <code>
              picButtons.forEach(btn =&gt; {<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;btn.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {<br />});<br />

            Enjoyed collaborating with my groupmates for this project. Learned
            how to use <code>scroll-behavior</code> and
            <code>scroll-snap-type</code> to create a smooth scrolling
            single-page website. Looking forward to using this more for future
            websites! <br /><br />

            Created a website based on the documentary "The Social Dilemma."
            Really like that we watched the documentary and changed my
            perspective on "being on my phone." Learned how to add more HTML
            components using JS.
            <br /><br />
            <code>inbox.append(email);</code>

            Another interesting and eye-opening documentary. This time, I tried
            to mimic a generational "reaction," continuing the idea from week 9.
            I struggled a bit with adding this "time" component since the
            comments popped up at different times instead of instantly like week
            9's website. <br />
            <br />
            <code>setTimeout(() => addComment(commentSect, comment));</code>
